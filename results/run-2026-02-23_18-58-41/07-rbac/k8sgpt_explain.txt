0: Deployment 07-rbac/rbac-test()
- Error: Deployment 07-rbac/rbac-test has 1 replicas but 0 are available with status running
Error: Deployment "07-rbac/rbac-test" has 1 replicas but 0 are available with status running.

Solution: 
1. Check pod logs for errors using `kubectl logs -f <pod_name>`.
2. Verify if the deployment is stuck in a pending state due to network issues or resource constraints.
3. Scale down and then back up the deployment to force recreation of pods.
4. If still not working, check RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) configuration for any restrictions on pod creation.

Note: This solution assumes that the issue is not related to a larger problem with the cluster or a more complex deployment setup.
1: ConfigMap 07-rbac/kube-root-ca.crt()
- Error: ConfigMap kube-root-ca.crt is not used by any pods in the namespace
Error: ConfigMap kube-root-ca.crt is not used by any pods in the namespace.

Solution: 
1. Check if the ConfigMap is actually created: `kubectl get configmaps`
2. Verify if the ConfigMap is referenced in a Deployment or Pod YAML file.
3. If not, create a new Deployment or Pod that uses the ConfigMap as a volume mount.
4. Apply the changes with `kubectl apply` and verify the pod is running successfully.
2: Pod 07-rbac/rbac-test-cb7dcb677-blcpw(Deployment/rbac-test)
- Error: the last termination reason is Error container=kubectl pod=rbac-test-cb7dcb677-blcpw
Error: The pod terminated due to an error in one of its containers.

Solution: 
1. Check the container logs using `kubectl logs -n <namespace> rbac-test-cb7dcb677-blcpw`.
2. Identify the issue causing the container failure.
3. Fix the issue or update the container image if necessary.
4. Restart the pod using `kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>` (if deployed) or `kubectl apply -f <pod-definition-file>.yaml`.
