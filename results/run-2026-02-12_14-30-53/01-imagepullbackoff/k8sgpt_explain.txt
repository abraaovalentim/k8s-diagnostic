0: Deployment 01-imagepullbackoff/bad-image()
- Error: Deployment 01-imagepullbackoff/bad-image has 1 replicas but 0 are available with status running
Error: Deployment "01-imagepullbackoff/bad-image" has 1 replicas but 0 are available with status running.

Solution: 
1. Check image pull secrets and ensure they're correct.
2. Verify the image exists in the registry or update the deployment to use a different image.
3. Run `kubectl rollout status` to check the deployment's status.
4. If still issues, try deleting and re-creating the deployment.
1: ConfigMap 01-imagepullbackoff/kube-root-ca.crt()
- Error: ConfigMap kube-root-ca.crt is not used by any pods in the namespace
Error: ConfigMap kube-root-ca.crt is not used by any pods in the namespace.

Solution: 
1. Check if the ConfigMap is being referenced in a Deployment, StatefulSet, or Pod YAML file.
2. Verify that the ConfigMap name matches exactly with the one in the YAML file (case-sensitive).
3. If using a Deployment or StatefulSet, check the `spec.template.spec.containers[0].env` section for any environment variables referencing the ConfigMap.
4. Run `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>` to ensure no pods are stuck in a pending state.
5. If still not working, try deleting and re-creating the ConfigMap or pod YAML file.
2: Pod 01-imagepullbackoff/bad-image-78ffccb955-pqt2z(Deployment/bad-image)
- Error: Back-off pulling image "nginx:tag-inexistente"
Error: Unable to pull image "nginx:tag-inexistente" due to non-existent tag.

Solution: 
1. Check if the tag exists on Docker Hub or other registry.
2. If not, create a new tag for the desired version of Nginx.
3. Update your Kubernetes deployment YAML file with the correct tag.
4. Apply the changes using `kubectl apply`.
