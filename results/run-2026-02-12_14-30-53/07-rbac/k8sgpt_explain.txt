0: Deployment 07-rbac/rbac-test()
- Error: Deployment 07-rbac/rbac-test has 1 replicas but 0 are available with status running
Error: Deployment "07-rbac/rbac-test" has 1 replicas but 0 are available with status running.

Solution: 
1. Check deployment logs for errors using `kubectl logs -f <deployment-name>`.
2. Verify pod is stuck in a specific state (e.g., CrashLoopBackOff) and troubleshoot the issue.
3. If pods are not scaling up, check node availability and resource utilization.
4. Try rolling back to a previous version or deleting and re-creating the deployment if necessary.
1: ConfigMap 07-rbac/kube-root-ca.crt()
- Error: ConfigMap kube-root-ca.crt is not used by any pods in the namespace
Error: ConfigMap kube-root-ca.crt is not used by any pods in the namespace.

Solution: 
1. Check if the ConfigMap is created correctly using `kubectl get configmap kube-root-ca.crt -o yaml`.
2. Verify if the ConfigMap is being used by any pods using `kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l "configmap=kube-root-ca.crt"`.
3. If no pods are using the ConfigMap, check if there are any Deployment or StatefulSet objects that reference this ConfigMap.
4. Update or recreate the pods/deployments/statefulsets to use the ConfigMap.
5. If still not working, try deleting and re-creating the ConfigMap.
2: Pod 07-rbac/rbac-test-cb7dcb677-vxvmq(Deployment/rbac-test)
- Error: the last termination reason is Error container=kubectl pod=rbac-test-cb7dcb677-vxvmq
Error: The pod is terminated due to an error in one of its containers.

Solution: 
1. Check the container logs for errors using `kubectl logs rbac-test-cb7dcb677-vxvmq -c kubectl`.
2. Verify if the container is running with correct permissions and roles.
3. If the issue persists, try restarting the pod or deleting and recreating it.

Note: The error message suggests that the termination reason is due to an error in the `kubectl` container itself, which is used for managing the pod.
