0: Deployment 03-missing-configmap/missing-config()
- Error: Deployment 03-missing-configmap/missing-config has 1 replicas but 0 are available with status running
Error: Deployment "03-missing-configmap/missing-config" has 1 replicas but 0 are available with status running.

Solution: 
1. Check if the ConfigMap is created and deployed correctly.
2. Verify if the pod's logs show any errors or issues.
3. Run `kubectl rollout status` to check the deployment's status.
4. If still not working, try deleting and re-creating the deployment.
1: ConfigMap 03-missing-configmap/kube-root-ca.crt()
- Error: ConfigMap kube-root-ca.crt is not used by any pods in the namespace
Error: ConfigMap kube-root-ca.crt is not used by any pods in the namespace.

Solution: 
1. Check if the ConfigMap is created correctly using `kubectl get configmap kube-root-ca.crt -o yaml`.
2. Verify if the ConfigMap is being used by a pod or deployment using `kubectl describe pod/deployment <pod_name>` and checking for references to the ConfigMap.
3. If no pods are referencing the ConfigMap, ensure that the ConfigMap is in the same namespace as the pods or deployments that should be using it.
4. If still not working, try deleting and re-creating the ConfigMap or updating the pods/deployments to reference the new ConfigMap.
2: Pod 03-missing-configmap/missing-config-777c8c7857-56qp5(Deployment/missing-config)
- Error: configmap "config-inexistente" not found
Error: --- configmap "config-inexistente" not found ---

Solution: 
1. Check if the ConfigMap exists in your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl get configmaps`.
2. If it doesn't exist, create a new ConfigMap with the desired configuration.
3. Verify that the ConfigMap is correctly created and updated.
4. If you're still facing issues, check for any typos or incorrect namespace/selector usage in your application's code.
